# Hi, I'm Oliver.

I'm a developer who is passionate about building high-quality software. I believe the best digital products are the ones you can depend on—they're fast, robust, and straightforward to manage behind the scenes. That's why I'm committed to writing simple, maintainable, and performant code in everything I build. Below, you'll find some projects where I put these ideas into practice.

- [[Kiln]], an Obsidian static website generator written in Go.
- [[Zigboy]], a Gameboy (DMG) emulator in Zig.
- [[Specter the Reaper]], my first attempt at game design in Unity.

Today, I work as a full-stack developer with a focus on TypeScript and Go. While I enjoy building high-quality applications, I am channeling that passion for quality and resilience into a new focus: cybersecurity. I am actively preparing for a career as a penetration tester, where I can use my developer's perspective to find and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. More about me [[About|here]].

Sometimes I write about software, security, and what I'm learning in general. If you are interested you can find my articles in the [[Blog.base|blog section]].0
