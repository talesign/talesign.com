# About

<hr/>

My journey with code started back when I was 15, tinkering with <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-html5-plain"></i> HTML</span> and <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-css3-plain"></i> CSS</span> to build small websites. There's a special kind of magic to making something appear on a screen for the first time, and that feeling has stuck with me ever since.

Along the way, I’ve had my share of wrestling with platforms like <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-wordpress-plain"></i> WordPress</span> which mostly taught me what I didn't want in a tech stack—and pushed me towards creating more robust, maintainable, and custom solutions. I followed my passion for creativity to <a href="https://www.iaad.it" target="_blank" class="inline-flex gap-1 items-baseline">IAAD</a>, where I earned a degree in design. It was a fantastic experience that sharpened my eye for aesthetics and marketing, but I quickly realized that what truly excited me was not just how things looked, but how they worked. The development side was calling my name, and I knew something was missing.

After graduating, I dove headfirst into freelance work. I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with many talented professionals and small businesses, helping them solve real-world problems. This is where I honed my core toolkit: <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-typescript-plain"></i> TypeScript</span> for crafting beautiful, interactive frontends and <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-go-plain"></i> Go</span> for building the fast, reliable backends that power them.

When I’m not on the clock, my curiosity runs wild. I'm currently diving deep into system-level languages like <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-c-original"></i> C</span> and <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-zig-original"></i> Zig</span> to better understand how software truly interacts with hardware. This same curiosity leads me to dabble in <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-csharp-plain"></i> C#</span> and <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-unity-plain"></i> Unity</span> for a bit of game development, configure my entire setup with <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-nixos-plain"></i> Nix</span>, and explore what’s possible with <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-godot-plain"></i> Godot</span> I believe that constantly learning keeps my skills sharp and my work interesting.

When I finally do step away from the keyboard, it's usually because my two Shiba Inus, Barro and Shiori, are demanding a walk or a play session.

Right now, I’m balancing freelance projects with studying for my first penetration testing certification. I’m channeling my passion for building robust systems into learning how to defend them. It's an exciting new chapter, and I can't wait to see what's next.
