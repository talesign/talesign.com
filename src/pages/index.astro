  <h1>Hi, I'm Oliver.</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>I'm a developer who is passionate about building high-quality software. I believe the best digital products are the ones you can depend onâ€”they're fast, robust, and straightforward to manage behind the scenes. That's why I'm committed to writing simple, maintainable, and performant code in everything I build. Below, you'll find some projects where I put these ideas into practice.</p>
  <ul>
    {filteredProjects.map((item: any) => (
      <li><a href={item.data.link} class="flex gap-2 items-baseline" target="_blank">{item.data.title}</a></li>
    ))}
    <li><a href="/projects" class="flex gap-2 items-baseline">View more projects</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Today, I work as a full-stack developer with a focus on <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-typescript-plain"></i> TypeScript</span> and <span class="tech"><i class="devicon-go-plain"></i> Go</span>. While I enjoy building high-quality applications, I am channeling that passion for quality and resilience into a new focus: cybersecurity. I am actively preparing for a career as a penetration tester, where I can use my developer's perspective to find and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.</p>
  <hr>
  Sometimes I write about software, security, and what I'm learning in general.
